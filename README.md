## Programming Languages

- C++ - 25+ years of using as a primary working language. 9+ years of
  working on a compilers and tools for the language.
- C# - 15+ years of using as a language for GUI programming in Windows
  related projects.
- C (used on and off the entire career)
- Python, Bash, Awk, Perl, and other scripting languages (used for small tasks)
- Java - learned and used at some hobby projects.
- Scala, Haskell - learned both languages using online courses but
  have not had a chance to apply it on a real mature project.

# Job Experience

## 2012-2019 MIPS Technologies, Imaginations Technologies, Wave Computing
*Independent contractor*

I worked on MIPS-related improvements in the Clang compiler's
frontend, LLVM backend, LLD linker, and some LLVM tools. A separate
project was supporting MIPS architecture in the MCLinker. I was a
"code owner" of the MIPS backend in the LLVM project for four years.

- In the Clang frontend I implemented some MIPS specific attributes
  and pragmas, improved support of MIPS toolchains in the Clang's driver.
- In the MIPS LLVM backend I fixed numerous bugs, supported new
  instructions, and implemented some optimizations.
- In the LLD linker I worked on everything related to linking MIPS
  architectureâ€™s code. Now this linker is a default system linker on
  FreeBSD systems.

## 2008-present VisualSVN Ltd.
*Co-founder and senior software engineer*

Co-founder of VisualSVN Ltd. I work mainly as a software developer. The company develops two products: VisualSVN - Visual Studio plugin integrates Subversion version control system and VisualSVN Server - Subversion server with Windows Integrated Authentication support, comprehensive web interface, and remote management console. I participate in the development of almost all parts of these products from scratch.

## 2004-2008 Sun Microsystems
*Senior software engineer*

Improved Sun C++ compiler frontend in templates handling and other modern C++ standard features. Fixed numerous bugs. In less than a year of work 20+ years old compiler started to support most of the language features required by the Boost library. Took part in Itanium C++ ABI (aka g++ ABI) implementation.

## 2000-2004 Transas
*Senior software engineer*

I was responsible for design and development vessel traffic control system. I implemented such parts of the system like AIS control unit, software library for transmitting and processing video data received from radar, record and playback vessel traffic, remote control of the system's modules using SNMP protocol, chart editor.

## 1996-2000 Irga
*Software engineer*

I was responsible for implementation of various software modules for a radio-monitoring equipment. Worked on Morse signal decoding, developed database to store results of radio-monitoring, implemented a library for plotting GUI charts.
